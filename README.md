# Munger's Compass

Munger's Compass is a web app that helps you evaluate purchases using Charlie Munger's rational investing principles. Provide an item's details and your optional financial profile to get a buy/don't-buy recommendation and potential cheaper alternatives.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development servers in separate terminals:
   ```bash
   npm run dev        # Next.js app on http://localhost:9002
   npm run genkit:dev # Genkit AI flows
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:9002` and follow the prompts to analyze a purchase.
